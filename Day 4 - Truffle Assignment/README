Truffle Assignment
In today's assignment, you will be working more with Truffle on your own in order to get more comfortable with this tool. 

I want you to create a Truffle project out of your ERC20 code from last week.

Hand in a link to your code in Google Classroom.

Create a new folder with new truffle project in it.
Add all your ERC20 code into the project.
Create a migration file for your ERC20 code that deploys your code and automatically mints 100 tokens to an address of your choice.
Migrate, launch the truffle console and confirm that this address now has a balance of 100 tokens.

Bonus Assignment (Difficult Level)

Read the following guide on unit testing in Truffle https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript
Implement a unit test that automatically tests so that the balance of your address of choice is actually 100 after migration.
